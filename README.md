## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Here's what you need to be able to run IronLibrary:

- Java (version >= 21)
- MySQL Database
- Maven

### 1. Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/evagapi/homework-java-ironlibrary.git
cd homework-java-ironlibrary
```

### 2. Install Maven dependencies

Using Command Line

```shell
mvn install
```
Using IntelliJ IDEA
- Open IntelliJ IDEA.
- Open the ironlibrary project.
- Navigate to View > Tool Windows > Maven.
- Click on Reload All Maven Projects icon to update dependencies.
- Alternatively, right-click on pom.xml and select Reload Project.

## Configure MySQL 

### Create your local profile resources file

You are provided with an example file named [application-local_example.properties](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fapplication-local_example.properties). Rename it to `application-local.properties` and change the properties to match your configuration:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:[yourlocalhostport]/[yourdatabasename]?serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.username=[youruser]
spring.datasource.password=[yourpassword]
```

### First Run

The database will be automatically created the first time you run the application with the following configurations:

```shell
spring.profiles.active=local

spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create

spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```
### After the First Run

After the first run, you need to update the `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` to `update` to prevent data overwriting. 
You can update `spring.jpa.show-sql` to `false` to disable SQL logging.
